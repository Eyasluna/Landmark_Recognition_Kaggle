# Landmark_Recognition_Kaggle
Landmark Recognition Challenge is a machine-learning challenge which held by Google through Kaggle.com.
Implemented SIFT algorithm for images to extracts feature descriptors at feature points.
Used K-means cluster to transform feature points to visual words then scored them by TF-IDF.

The result came out as 10.2%, 10.6%, and 10.5% correctness respectfully. Overall, our recognition model is able to correctly recognize 10.42% images. It cannot compare with the first place challenger from Kaggle, who holds a record of 30.4% correctness. After checking with the leaderboard from Kaggle landmark recognition challenging page, the overall rank should arund 88/100.

This is the final project for CMPS140-Artificial-intelligence at UC Santa Cruz Spring 2018. Received B+ for its final grade.
